        <SectionTitle>Section 1 · The Creator's Story</SectionTitle>
        <Body>
          This platform was built by Devbrat — not from a coaching hub, not with a mentor on speed
          dial, but from a desk with a single lamp and too many unanswered questions. Privilege
          opens doors; execution decides what happens once you are inside. Having faced failed
          attempts, wasted months, and syllabi abandoned halfway despite access to top-tier
          resources, the uncomfortable truth became clear: resources don't win battles, execution
          does. What changed wasn't magic motivation — it was building a system that refused to let
          me lie to myself about the hours actually put in.
        </Body>

        <SectionTitle>Section 2 · Why "From The Last Bench"?</SectionTitle>
        <Body>
          Society has a habit of writing off the person sitting on the last bench. They assume it's
          the place for the distracted, the underachievers, and those who aren't "gifted" enough to
          sit in the front row.
        </Body>
        <Body>We are here to change that narrative completely.</Body>
        <Body>
          This platform was built specifically for the student who doesn't feel like a born genius.
          It's for those who look at the "top scorers" and feel intimidated, wondering if they
          simply lack the raw talent to compete.
        </Body>
        <Body>
          Here is what nobody tells you: Daily, relentless effort beats raw talent every single day.
          Talent might give someone a head start, but unapplied genius always gets overtaken by the
          person who simply refuses to stop showing up. It might feel like you are falling behind
          right now, but consistency compounds in silence. At the end of the road, the last bencher
          who stayed consistent is the one who wins.
        </Body>

        <SectionTitle>Section 3 · The Unforgiving Truth About Solitude</SectionTitle>
        <Body>
          We live in an age of infinite content. You can buy the best lectures, download thousands
          of PDFs, and sit in the most expensive classrooms. But when the screen turns off and the
          door closes, none of that matters.
        </Body>
        <Body>
          What determines your destiny are those quiet, unglamorous, and often painful lonely hours
          of self-study.
        </Body>
        <Body>
          It's just you, your desk, and your willingness to sit in silence when your mind is
          desperate for a distraction. That single daily battle against your own hesitation is the
          ultimate equalizer. Until you master those silent hours, no amount of privilege or content
          can save you.
        </Body>

        <SectionTitle>Section 4 · Why This Platform Exists</SectionTitle>
        <Body>
          I built From The Last Bench to be a companion for anyone sitting alone at 2 AM trying to
